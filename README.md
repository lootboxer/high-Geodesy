### Practical recommendations of the university program (search at http://www.miigaik.ru/students/materials/tutorials)

Priority was placed on displaying the results of calculations relative to the option that was issued to the student, so some parameters are part of the curriculum

I tried to implement an object oriented model, each module is one lesson that is part of the next lesson...
First module is "Proection". For calculating was been used 3 proections of Earth: PZ90, WGS84, and Krasovsky.
